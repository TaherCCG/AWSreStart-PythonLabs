# AWS re/Start Labs

## Description.
AWS re/start labs learning Python.
Each Lab is in a separate folder, named as L1-helloWorld for Lab 1, and so on.

### L1 Hello World
**Lab Overview**
*Make your first Python Program*
- My first Python Program "Hello, World"


### L2 Working with Numeric Data Types
**Lab Overview**
*Explore the basic data types that are used to store numeric values.*

- Use the Python shell    (CLI)
- Use the int data type
- Use the float data type
- Use the complex data type
- Use the bool data type

### L3 Working with the String Data Type
**Lab Overview**
*In Python, a collection of letters and symbols is called a string. Strings are used often in Python for input and output.*

- Write Python code that uses the string data type
- Concatenate strings
- Use the string to get input
- Format strings for output

### L4 Working with Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries
**Lab Overview**
*In Python, string and numeric data types are often used in groups called collections. Three such collections that Python supports are the list, the tuple, and the dictionary.*

- Use the list data type
- Use the tuple data type
- Use the dictionary data type


### L5 Categorizing Values
**Lab Overview**
*With Python, you can mix types in a list. In this lab, you will create a list with different types and print the values.*

- Use numeric data types
- Use string data types
- Use the list data type
- Use a for loop
- Use the print() function

### L6 Working with Composite Data Types
**Lab Overview**
*A composite data type is any data type that comprises primitive data types. If you like food, you can visualize a composite data type as a turducken, which is a dish that consists of a chicken that is stuffed into a duck, which is stuffed into a turkey. In this lab, you will create a data type that consists of a string that is in a dictionary, which is in a list.*

- Use numeric data types
- Use string data types
- Use the dictionary data type
- Use the list data type
- Use a for loop
- Use the print() function
- Use the if statement
- Use the else statement
- Use the import statement

### L7 Working with Conditionals
**Lab Overview**
*A section of code that compares two pieces of information is called a conditional statement. You can use conditionals to create different paths through the program. Using comparative operators, you will write a program that makes decisions.*

- Use the if statement
- Use the else statement
- Use the elif statement

### L8 Working with Loops
**Lab Overview**
*A loop is a segment of code that repeats. You will be introduced to two types of loops: the while loop and the for loop.*

- Use a while loop
- Use a for loop

### L9 Make GitHub 
**Lab Overview**
GitHub runs an instance of git, which is version-control software that runs in the cloud. GitHub is popular among open source projects and businesses.

- Download solutions for the earlier labs
- Create a GitHub account
- Read the GitHub Hello World guide
- Create a private repository for your labs
- Download your repository
